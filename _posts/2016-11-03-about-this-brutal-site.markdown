This is the simplest version a website can be displayed. This is lightweight, accessible, perfect for flaky networks,
has no Javascript or client side rendering of any kind, and it even is responsive.

I am a frontend developer and I know how to make a pretty interface, but I leave it brutalized for maintainability purposes.
It is called brutal because it is effortless, and it doesn't fulfill the UI of conventional websites. Hope you enjoy
the content and not the shell.
