I was born and raised in Mexico, and I have been traveling since a very young age, moving from one city to another. Every couple years, my parents would move us to a new city, new house, new school, new friends.
</p>
<p>
Although Mexico is fairly homogeneous, the regionalisms spoken in the north are different from those in the south, and hardly understood if you are coming from the opposite side of the country. With every move, I had to adapt my speech, my manners and my conduct.
</p>
<p>
It was until I started traveling around the globe that I noticed I might have to adapt many more things. I remember one of my trips to Turkey, I was in a small town in the area of Nevsehir. I was sweating, it was hot, I was a tourist, I was wearing a tank top. While walking my way into a restaurant, a couple women tried to tell me something from far, and they were pointing at the lack of sleeves of my top. I mean, Nevsehir is a touristic site, right? But then an old lady looked pissed and some men were staring, this drove me mad. My thoughts were kind of like this:
</p>

<ul>
<li>It’s not my fault, I was told it is ok to be like this in Turkey.</li>
<li>Dear lord, I am not Muslim, give it a rest!</li>
<li>People won’t stop staring, I am being judged.</li>
<li>I will go to Muslim hell.</li>
<li>Ooookay! It’s 36°C, but I will cover now.</li>
<li>Or maybe not. I bet this is not against the law.</li>
<li>That old lady is yelling, covering now…</li>
<li>The agony stopped, people went back to normal. Men stopped staring too.</li>
<li>I am an idiot.</li>
<li>Maybe I should be respectful and learn a bit of how they do things here before doing anything stupid again.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I regret not knowing how to be civilised early enough. I wished there was a way to avoid falling in the traps of cultural differences. Perhaps close observation makes you aware of them, but you know what they say, <i>"live it to believe it”</i>.
</p>
<p>
Bringing this example into our web development processes, how is it expected from Product Owners to think of inclusive UX when they have never had the need of it? Sometimes it is not all about their call, sometimes the lack of vision comes from a higher hierarchy. Is anyone in your team (besides the designer) aware of the UX challenges and the need of investing in them? Are you sure your website is not hurting anyone?
</p>
<p>
I know, I cannot ask you to have experience in every case scenario, but when somebody in Turkey tells you to cover your shoulders because it hurts their sensitivity, maybe you should give it to them. Just like if somebody tells you there are people out there with disabilities, flaky networks or special devices and <b>they want to use your website</b>, you should consider it and give it to them.
</p>
<p>
Just because the less fortunate are not as loud as offended people, it doesn’t mean they don’t deserve a chance to have a descent web experience. It should be a social responsibility for people involved in web development to push this topic,
because to me it is now as important as being respectful to the country I travel to.
</p>
<p>
We already have a big advantage when browsers are able to adapt themselves to satisfy those cases, is it part of your plan to adapt your manners towards them too or should I wait until you live it to believe it?
